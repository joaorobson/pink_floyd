out the easy meat with your eyes closed\nAnd then moving in silently, down wind and out of sight\nYou gotta strike when the moment is right without thinking\nAnd after a while, you can work on points for style\nLike the club tie, and the firm handshake\nA certain look in the eye and an easy smile\nYou have to be trusted by the people that you lie to\nSo that when they turn their backs on you\nYou'll get the chance to put the knife in\n\nYou gotta keep one eye looking over your shoulder\nYou know, it's going to get harder, and harder, and harder\nAs you get older\nYeah, and in the end you'll pack up and fly down south\nHide your head in the sand\nJust another sad old man\nAll alone and dying of cancer\n\nAnd when you lose control, you'll reap the harvest you have sown\nAnd as the fear grows, the bad blood slows and turns to stone\nAnd it's too late to lose the weight you used to need to throw around\nSo have a good drown, as you go down all alone\nDragged down by the stone\n\n(stone, stone, stone...)\n\nGotta admit that I'm a little bit confused\nSometimes it seems to me as if I'm just being used\nGotta stay awake, gotta try and shake off this creeping malaise\nIf I don't stand my own ground, how can I find my way out of this maze\nDeaf, dumb and blind, you just keep on pretending\nThat everyone's expendable, and no one has a real friend\nAnd it seems to you the thing to do would be to isolate the winner\nEverything's done under the sun\nBut you believe at heart everyone's a killer\n\nWho was born in a house full of pain\nWho was trained not to spit in the fan\nWho was told what to do by the man\nWho was broken by trained personnel\nWho was fitted with collar and chain\nWho was given a pat on the back\nWho was breaking away from the pack\nWho was only a stranger at home\nWho was ground down in the end\nWho was found dead on the phone\nWho was dragged down by the stone\nWho was dragged down by the stone", "image":

easy meat with your eyes closed\nAnd then moving in silently, down wind and out of sight\nYou gotta strike when the moment is right without thinking\nAnd after a while, you can work on points for style\nLike the club tie, and the firm handshake\nA certain look in the eye and an easy smile\nYou have to be trusted by the people that you lie to\nSo that when they turn their backs on you\nYou'll get the chance to put the knife in\n\nYou gotta keep one eye looking over your shoulder\nYou know, it's going to get harder, and harder, and harder\nAs you get older\nYeah, and in the end you'll pack up and fly down south\nHide your head in the sand\nJust another sad old man\nAll alone and dying of cancer\n\nAnd when you lose control, you'll reap the harvest you have sown\nAnd as the fear grows, the bad blood slows and turns to stone\nAnd it's too late to lose the weight you used to need to throw around\nSo have a good drown, as you go down all alone\nDragged down by the stone\n\n(stone, stone, stone...)\n\nGotta admit that I'm a little bit confused\nSometimes it seems to me as if I'm just being used\nGotta stay awake, gotta try and shake off this creeping malaise\nIf I don't stand my own ground, how can I find my way out of this maze\nDeaf, dumb and blind, you just keep on pretending\nThat everyone's expendable, and no one has a real friend\nAnd it seems to you the thing to do would be to isolate the winner\nEverything's done under the sun\nBut you believe at heart everyone's a killer\n\nWho was born in a house full of pain\nWho was trained not to spit in the fan\nWho was told what to do by the man\nWho was broken by trained personnel\nWho was fitted with collar and chain\nWho was given a pat on the back\nWho was breaking away from the pack\nWho was only a stranger at home\nWho was ground down in the end\nWho was found dead on the phone\nWho was dragged down by the stone\nWho was dragged down by the stone"}}, {"title": "Pigs (Three Different Ones)", "album": "Shine

nearly a laugh\nYou\u2019re nearly a laugh\nBut you\u2019re really a cry\n\nBus stop rat bag\nHa ha charade you are\nYou fucked up old hag\nHa ha charade you are\nYou radiate cold shafts of broken glass\nYou\u2019re nearly a good laugh\nAlmost worth a quick grin\nYou like the feel of steel\nYou\u2019re hot stuff with a hatpin\nAnd good fun with a hand gun\n\nYou\u2019re nearly a

feelings off the street\nYou\u2019re nearly a real treat\nAll tight lips and cold feet\nAnd do you feel abused?\nYou gotta stem the evil tide\nAnd keep it all on the inside\n\nMary you\u2019re nearly

pretending the danger's not real\nMeek and obedient you follow the leader\nDown well trodden corridors into the valley of steel\nWhat a surprise!\nA look of terminal shock in your eyes\nNow things are really what they seem\nNo, this is no bad dream\n\n(stone, stone, stone...)\nThe Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want\nHe makes me down to lie\nThrough pastures green He leadeth me the silent waters by\nWith bright knives He releaseth my soul\nHe maketh me to hang on hooks in high places\nHe converteth me to lamb cutlets\nFor lo, He hath great power, and great hunger\nWhen cometh the day we lowly ones\nThrough quiet reflection, and great dedication\nMaster the art of karate\nLo, we shall rise up\nAnd then we'll make the bugger's eyes water\n\nBleating and babbling we fell on his neck with a scream\nWave upon wave of demented avengers\nMarch cheerfully out of obscurity into the dream\nHave you heard the news?\nThe dogs are dead!\nYou better stay home\nAnd do as you're told\nGet out of the

about\nI've looked over Jordan, and I have seen\nThings are not what they seem\n\nWhat do you get for pretending the danger's not real\nMeek and obedient you follow the leader\nDown well trodden corridors into the valley of steel\nWhat a surprise!\nA look of terminal shock in your eyes\nNow things are really what they seem\nNo, this is no bad dream\n\n(stone, stone, stone...)\nThe Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want\nHe makes me down to lie\nThrough pastures green He leadeth me the silent waters by\nWith bright knives He releaseth my soul\nHe maketh me to hang on hooks in high places\nHe converteth me to lamb cutlets\nFor lo, He hath great power, and great hunger\nWhen cometh the day we lowly ones\nThrough quiet reflection, and great dedication\nMaster the art of karate\nLo, we shall rise up\nAnd then we'll make the bugger's eyes water\n\nBleating and babbling we fell on his neck with a scream\nWave upon wave of demented avengers\nMarch cheerfully out of obscurity into the dream\nHave you heard the news?\nThe dogs are dead!\nYou better stay home\nAnd do as you're told\nGet out of the road if you want to grow old"}}, {"title": "Pigs on the Wing (Part
