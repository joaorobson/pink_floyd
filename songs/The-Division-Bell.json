don\u2019t know? (What do you want from me?)\nIf I don\u2019t promise you the answers would you go? (What do you want from me?)\nShould I stand out in the rain?\nDo you want me to make a daisy chain for you?\n\nI\u2019m not the one you need\n\nWhat do you want from me?\n\nYou can have anything you want\nYou can drift, you can dream, even walk on water\nAnything you want\nYou can own everything you see\nSell your soul for complete control\nIs that really what you need?\nYou can lose yourself this night\nSee inside, there is nothing to hide\nTurn and face the light\n\nWhat do you want from me?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d2c1a33665e936762167651028b2b09d.513x500x1.jpg", "artist":

glasses high we raised a cry for freedom had arrived\nOn the day the wall came down\nThe Ship of Fools had finally run aground\nPromises lit up the night like paper doves in flight\n\nI dreamed you had left my side\nNo warmth, not even pride remained\nAnd even though you needed me\nIt was clear that I could not do a thing for you\n\nNow life devalues day by day\nAs friends and neighbors turn away\nAnd there\u2019s a change that, even with regret, cannot be undone\nNow frontiers shift like desert sands\nWhile nations wash their bloodied hands\nOf loyalty, of history, in shades of grey\n\nI woke to the sound of drums\nThe music played, the morning sun streamed in\nI turned and I looked at you\nAnd all but the bitter residues slipped away...\nSlipped away"}}, {"title": "Wearing the Inside

to)\nOn the inside out (\u2026curse the place)\nMy skin is cold (In a sea of random images)\nTo the human touch (The self-destructing animal)\nThis bleeding heart\u2019s (Waiting for the waves to break)\nNot beating much\n\nI murmured a vow of silence and now\nI don\u2019t even hear when I think aloud\nExtinguished by light I turn on the night\nWear its darkness with an empty smile\n\nI\u2019m creeping back to life\nMy nervous system all awry\nI\u2019m wearing the inside out\n\nLook at him now\nHe\u2019s paler somehow\nBut he\u2019s coming round\nHe\u2019s starting to choke\nIt\u2019s been so long since he spoke\nWell he can have the words right from my mouth\n\nAnd with these words I can see\nClear through the clouds that covered me\nJust give it time then speak my name\nNow we can hear ourselves again\nI\u2019m holding out (He\u2019s standing on the threshold)\nFor the day (Caught in fiery anger)\nWhen all the clouds (And hurled into the furnace he\u2019ll)\nHave blown away (\u2026curse the place)\nI\u2019m with you now (He\u2019s torn in all directions)\nCan speak your name (And still the screen is flickering)\nNow we can hear (Waiting for the flames to

word\u2026 overrun\n\nWon\u2019t hear a sound (He\u2019s curled into the corner)\nFrom my mouth (But still the screen is flickering)\nI\u2019ve spent too long (With an endless stream of garbage to)\nOn the inside out (\u2026curse the place)\nMy skin is cold (In a sea of random images)\nTo the human touch (The self-destructing animal)\nThis bleeding heart\u2019s (Waiting for the waves to break)\nNot beating much\n\nI murmured a vow of silence and now\nI don\u2019t even hear when I think aloud\nExtinguished by light I turn on the night\nWear its darkness with an empty smile\n\nI\u2019m creeping back to life\nMy nervous system all awry\nI\u2019m wearing the inside out\n\nLook at him now\nHe\u2019s paler somehow\nBut he\u2019s coming round\nHe\u2019s starting to choke\nIt\u2019s been so long since he spoke\nWell he can have the words right from my mouth\n\nAnd with these words I can see\nClear through the clouds that covered me\nJust give it time then speak my name\nNow we can hear ourselves again\nI\u2019m holding out (He\u2019s standing on the threshold)\nFor the day (Caught in fiery anger)\nWhen all the clouds (And hurled into the furnace he\u2019ll)\nHave blown away (\u2026curse the place)\nI\u2019m with you now (He\u2019s torn in all directions)\nCan speak your name (And still the screen is flickering)\nNow we can hear (Waiting for the flames to break)\nOurselves again"}}, {"title": "Take It Back", "album": "The Division Bell", "year": "1994-03-28", "lyrics": "Her love rains down on me easy as the breeze\nI listen to her breathing, it sounds like the waves on the sea\nI was thinking all about her, burning with rage and desire\nWe were spinning into darkness; the earth was on fire\n\nShe could take it back, she might take it back someday\n\nSo I spied on her, I lied to her, I made promises I cannot keep\nThen I hear their laughter rising, rising from the deep\nAnd I make her prove her love for me, I take all that I can take\nAnd I push her to the limit to see if she will break\n\nShe might take it back, she could take it back some day\n\nRing-a-ring o\u2019 roses\nA pocket full of posies\nA-tishoo! A-tishoo!\nWe all fall down\n\nNow I have seen the warnings, screaming from all sides\nIt\u2019s easy to ignore them, God knows I\u2019ve tried\nAll of this temptation, you know it turned my faith to lies\nUntil I couldn\u2019t see the danger or hear the rising tide\n\nShe can take it back, she will take it back some day\nShe can take it back, she will take it back some day\nShe will take it back,

like the waves on the sea\nI was thinking all about her, burning with rage and desire\nWe were spinning into darkness; the earth was on fire\n\nShe could take it back, she might take it back someday\n\nSo I spied on her, I lied to her, I made promises I cannot keep\nThen I hear their laughter rising, rising from the deep\nAnd I make her prove her love for me, I take all that I can take\nAnd I push her to the limit to see if she will break\n\nShe might take it back, she could take it back some day\n\nRing-a-ring o\u2019 roses\nA pocket full of posies\nA-tishoo! A-tishoo!\nWe all fall down\n\nNow I have seen the warnings, screaming from all sides\nIt\u2019s easy to ignore them, God knows I\u2019ve tried\nAll of this temptation, you know it turned my faith to lies\nUntil I couldn\u2019t see the danger or hear the rising tide\n\nShe can take it back, she will take it back some day\nShe can take it back, she will take it back some day\nShe will take it back, she will take it back some day"}}, {"title": "Coming Back to Life", "album": "The Division Bell", "year": "1994-03-28", "lyrics": "Where were you when I was burned and broken?\nWhile the days slipped by from my window watching\nAnd where were you when I was hurt and I was helpless?\n\u2018Cause the things you say and the things you do surround me\nWhile you were hanging yourself on someone else\u2019s words\nDying to believe in what you heard\nI was staring straight into the shining sun\n\nLost in thought and lost in time\nWhile the seeds of life and the seeds of change were planted\nOutside, the rain fell dark and slow\nWhile I pondered on this dangerous but irresistible pastime\nI took a heavenly ride through our silence\nI knew the moment had arrived\nFor killing the past and coming back to life\n\nI took a heavenly ride through our silence\nI knew the waiting had begun\nAnd headed straight\u2026 into the shining sun", "image": "https://i.genius.com/c3ab24060f77e9c2a297333c3c7e9c784580c734?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hipgnosiscovers.com%2Fimages%2F496_comingbacktolife_cds_us_front.jpg", "artist": "Pink Floyd", "raw": {"annotation_count": 2, "api_path": "/songs/146546", "apple_music_id": "1065976902", "apple_music_player_url": "https://genius.com/songs/146546/apple_music_player", "description": {"dom": {"tag": "root", "children": [{"tag": "p", "children": ["Possibly the finest moment on The Division Bell, Coming Back To The Life is about as personal a piece as Gilmour has ever turned out.

talk\n\nThere\u2019s a silence surrounding me\nI can\u2019t seem to think straight\nI\u2019ll sit in the corner\nAnd no one can bother me\nI think I should speak now (Why won\u2019t you talk to me?)\nI can\u2019t seem to speak now (You never talk to me?)\nMy words won\u2019t come out right (What are you thinking?)\nI feel like I\u2019m drowning (What are you feeling?)\nI\u2019m feeling weak now (Why won\u2019t you talk to me?)\nBut I can\u2019t show my weakness (You never talk to me?)\nI sometimes wonder (What are you thinking?)\nWhere do we go from here (What are you feeling?)\n\nIt

not going to help at all\n\u2018Cause there\u2019ll be no safety in numbers\nWhen the right one walks out of the door\n\nLadies and gentlemen!\nThe winner\nBy a knockout\n\nCan you see your days blighted by darkness?\nIs it true you beat your fists on the floor?\nStuck in a world of isolation\nWhile the ivy grows over the door\nSo I open my door to my enemies\nAnd I ask \"could we wipe the

horizon of the place we lived when we were young\nIn a world of magnets and miracles\nOur thoughts strayed constantly and without boundary\nThe ringing of the division bell had begun\nAlong the Long Road and on down the Causeway\nDo they still meet there by the Cut\nThere was a ragged band that followed in our footsteps\nRunning before time took our dreams away\nLeaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground\nTo a life consumed by slow decay\n\nThe grass was greener\nThe light was brighter\nWith friends surrounded\nThe nights of wonder\n\nLooking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind us\nTo a glimpse of how green it was on the other side\nSteps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again\nDragged by the force of some inner tide\nAt a higher altitude with flag unfurled\nWe reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world\n\n\nEncumbered forever by desire and ambition\nThere's a hunger still unsatisfied\nOur weary eyes still stray to the horizon\nThough down this road we've been so many times\n\nThe grass was greener\nThe light was brighter\nThe taste was sweeter\nThe nights of wonder\nWith friends surrounded\nThe dawn mist glowing\nThe water flowing\nThe endless river\nFor ever and ever\n\n\nIs that Charlie?

boundary\nThe ringing of the division bell had begun\nAlong the Long Road and on down the Causeway\nDo they still meet there by the Cut\nThere was a ragged band that followed in our footsteps\nRunning before time took our dreams away\nLeaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground\nTo a life consumed by slow decay\n\nThe grass was greener\nThe light was brighter\nWith friends surrounded\nThe nights of wonder\n\nLooking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind us\nTo a glimpse of how green it was on the other side\nSteps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again\nDragged by the force of some inner tide\nAt a higher altitude with flag unfurled\nWe reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world\n\n\nEncumbered forever by desire and ambition\nThere's a hunger still unsatisfied\nOur weary eyes still stray to the horizon\nThough down this road we've been so many times\n\nThe grass was greener\nThe light was brighter\nThe taste was sweeter\nThe nights of wonder\nWith friends surrounded\nThe dawn mist glowing\nThe water flowing\nThe endless river\nFor ever and ever\n\n\nIs that Charlie? Hello Charlie!\nGreat..."}}], "artist": "Pink Floyd"}
