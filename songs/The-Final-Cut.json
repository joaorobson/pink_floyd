How we used to be?\nDo you think we should be closer?\n\nShe stood in the doorway, the ghost of a smile\nHaunting her face like a cheap hotel sign\nHer cold eyes imploring the men in their MACs\nFor the gold in their bags or the knives in their backs\nStepping up boldly one put out his hand\nHe said, \u201cI was just a child then, now I\u2019m only a man.\u201d\n\nDo you remember me? How we used to be?\nDo you think we should be closer?\n\nBy the cold and religious we were taken in hand\nShown how to feel good and told to feel bad\n(Tongue tied and terrified we learned how to pray\nNow our feelings run deep and cold as the clay)\nStrung out behind us the banners and flags\nOf our possible pasts lie in tatters and rags\n\nDo you remember me?

be withdrawn\nAnd the Generals gave thanks as the other ranks\nHeld back the enemy tanks for a while\nAnd the Anzio bridgehead was held for the price\nOf a few hundred ordinary lives\n\nAnd kind old King George sent Mother a note\nWhen he heard that Father was gone\nIt was, I recall, in the form of a scroll\nWith gold leaf and all\nAnd I found it one day\nIn a drawer of old photographs, hidden away\nAnd my eyes still grow damp to remember\nHis Majesty signed with his own rubber stamp\n\nIt was dark all around, there was frost in the ground\nWhen the Tigers broke free\nAnd no one survived\nFrom the Royal Fusiliers Company Z\nThey were all left behind\nMost of them dead, the rest of them dying\nAnd that's how the High Command\nTook my daddy from me"}}, {"title": "The Hero's

hear the tolling bell\nAnd touch the silk in your lapel\nAnd as the tear drops rise to meet the comfort of the band\nYou take her frail hand\nAnd hold on to the dream!\nA place to stay\n\u201cOi! A real one \u2026\u201d\nEnough to eat\nSomewhere old heroes shuffle safely down the street\nWhere you can speak out loud\nAbout your doubts and fears\nAnd what\u2019s more no-one ever disappears\nYou never hear their standard issue kicking in your door\nYou can relax on both sides of the tracks\nAnd maniacs don\u2019t blow holes in bandsmen by remote control\nAnd everyone has recourse to the law\nAnd no one kills the children anymore\nAnd no one kills the children anymore\nNight after night\nGoing round and round my brain\nHis dream is driving me insane\nIn the corner of some foreign field\nThe gunner sleeps tonight\nWhat\u2019s done is done\nWe cannot just write off his final scene\nTake heed of the dream\nTake heed"}}, {"title": "Paranoid Eyes", "album": "The Final Cut", "year": "1983-03-21", "lyrics": "Button your lip andon\u2019t let the shield slip\nTake a fresh grip on your bullet proof mask\nAnd if they try to break down your disguise with their questions\nYou can hide, hide, hide\nBehind paranoid eyes\nYou put on our brave face and slip over the road for a jar\nFixing your grin as you casually lean on the bar\nLaughing too loud at the rest of the world\nWith the boys in the crowd\nYou can hide, hide, hide\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what, I\u2019ll give you three blacks, and play you for five\"\nBehind petrified eyes\n\u201cTa!

jar\nFixing your grin as you casually lean on the bar\nLaughing too loud at the rest of the world\nWith the boys in the crowd\nYou can hide, hide, hide\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what, I\u2019ll give you three blacks, and play you for five\"\nBehind petrified eyes\n\u201cTa! You was unlucky there son\u201d\nYou believed in their stories of fame, fortune and glory\nNow you\u2019re lost in a haze of alcohol soft middle age\nThe pie in the sky turned out to be miles too

knuckles\nWhite upon the slippery reins\nShe bravely waves the boys goodbye again\n\nAnd still the dark stain spreads between\nTheir shoulder blades\nA mute reminder of the poppy fields and

the priesthole\nAnd if I\u2019m in I\u2019ll tell you- (what\u2019s behind the wall)\n(Yahoo!)\n\nThere\u2019s a kid who had a big hallucination\nMaking love to girls in magazines\nHe wonders if you\u2019re sleeping with your new found faith\nCould anybody love him\nOr is it just a crazy dream?\n\nAnd if I show you my dark side\nWill you still hold me tonight?\nAnd if I open my heart to you\nAnd show you my weak side\nWhat would you do?\nWould you sell your story to Rolling Stone?\nWould you take the children away\nAnd leave me alone?\nAnd smile in reassurance\nAs you whisper down the phone?\nWould you send me packing?\nOr would you take me home?\n\nThought I oughta bare my naked feelings\nThought I oughta tear the curtain down\nI held the blade in trembling hands\nPrepared to make it but just then the phone rang\nI never had the nerve to make the final cut\n\n\u201cHello?

define the shape of this moment in time\nAnd far from flying high in clear blue skies\nI\u2019m spiraling down to the hole in the ground where I hide\nIf you negotiate the minefield in the drive\nAnd beat the dogs and cheat the cold electronic eyes\nAnd if you make it past the shotguns in the hall\nDial the combination, open the priesthole\nAnd if I\u2019m in I\u2019ll tell you- (what\u2019s behind the wall)\n(Yahoo!)\n\nThere\u2019s a kid who had a big hallucination\nMaking love to girls in magazines\nHe wonders if you\u2019re sleeping with your new found faith\nCould anybody love him\nOr is it just a crazy dream?\n\nAnd if I show you my dark side\nWill you still hold me tonight?\nAnd if I open my heart to you\nAnd show you my weak side\nWhat would you do?\nWould you sell your story to Rolling Stone?\nWould you take the children away\nAnd leave me alone?\nAnd smile in reassurance\nAs you whisper down the phone?\nWould you send me packing?\nOr would you take me home?\n\nThought I oughta bare my naked feelings\nThought I oughta tear the curtain down\nI held the blade in trembling hands\nPrepared to make it but just then the phone rang\nI never had the nerve to make the final cut\n\n\u201cHello?

undone\nAnd I suffer premonitions, confirm suspicions\nOf the holocaust to come\n\nThe rusty wire that holds the cork that keeps the anger in\nGives way and suddenly it\u2019s day again\nThe sun is in the east\nEven though the day is done\nTwo suns in the sunset, hmph\nCould be the human race is run\n\nLike the moment when the brakes lock\nAnd you slide towards the big truck (\u201cOh no!\u201d)\nYou stretch the frozen moments with your fear \nAnd you\u2019ll never hear their voices (\"Daddy, Daddy!\")\nAnd you\u2019ll never see their faces\nYou have no recourse to the law anymore\n\nAnd as the windshield melts and my tears evaporate\nLeaving only charcoal to defend\nFinally I understand\nThe feelings of the few\nAshes and diamonds,  foe and friend\nWe were all equal in the end\n\n\u201c\u2026and now the weather. Tomorrow will be cloudy with scattered showers spreading from the east \u2026\nWith an expected high of 4000 degrees Celsius\u201d"}}], "artist": "Pink Floyd"}
